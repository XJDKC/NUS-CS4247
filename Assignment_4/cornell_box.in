#=== SURFACES ===

#Number of surfaces.

#Each surface is made of one or more quadrilateral patches.
#For each surface, the first integer is the material index,
#the second integer is the number of quadrilateral patches,
#then followed by lines where each corresponds to a 
#quadrilateral patch. Each line has 4 integers, which are
#indices to the above vertices. The vertices must be listed
#in counter-clockwise direction when viewed from its frontside.
